### A simple explanation for everyone

**AI Co-Designer** is a smart assistant inside **NanoBio Studio**.  
Its purpose is to help you **decide which nanoparticle designs are worth testing**, before spending time and money in the lab.

st.markdown("""
Designing nanoparticles involves many choices:
- How big the particle should be  
- How charged it is  
- What it is made of  
- What drug it carries  
- How much of it is used  

There are **hundreds or thousands of possible combinations**.

Testing all of them in real experiments would be:
- Expensive  
- Time-consuming  
- Often unnecessary  

**AI Co-Designer helps you narrow this down to the best few options.**

st.markdown("""
Behind the scenes, AI Co-Designer:

1. Tries many nanoparticle designs on the computer  
2. Checks for each design:
   - How well it might work  
   - How risky it might be  
   - How difficult or costly it might be to make  
3. Compares all results  
4. Shows you **a ranked list of the most promising designs**

You stay in control — the system only **assists your decision**.

AI Co-Designer shows you:
- A short list of **top recommended designs**
- Simple charts showing trade-offs (performance vs safety vs cost)
- A confidence level for each recommendation
- Clear explanations of potential risks (for example: high dose or extreme charge)

1. Define reasonable ranges (size, charge, materials, dose)  
2. Choose what matters most (performance, safety, or cost)  
3. Click **Run Optimization**  
4. Review the recommended designs  
5. Select a few designs for real laboratory testing

st.markdown("""
To avoid misunderstanding:

- ❌ It does **not** replace laboratory experiments  
- ❌ It does **not** treat patients  
- ❌ It does **not** make medical or clinical decisions  

✔ It is a **decision-support tool**, designed to guide research planning.

AI Co-Designer helps:
- Save research time  
- Reduce experimental cost  
- Lower risk of failed experiments  
- Improve decision-making  
- Use labs and funding more efficiently
