"""
Scenario Presets Module

Provides pre-configured optimization scenarios for common use cases:
- Academic/Educational: Balanced learning
- Safety-First: Regulatory/translational programs
- Cost-Constrained: Manufacturing and scale-up
- Custom: User-defined

Each scenario includes:
- Objective weights (efficacy, safety, cost)
- Constraints (toxicity_max, cost_max)
- Recommended trial count and top-k
- Clear descriptions for stakeholders
